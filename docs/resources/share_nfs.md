# truenas_share_nfs (Resource)

Creating a Network File System (NFS) share on TrueNAS gives the benefit of making lots of data easily available for anyone with share access. Depending how the share is configured, users accessing the share can be restricted to read or write privileges. To create a new share, make sure a dataset is available with all the data for sharing.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "truenas_share_nfs" "nfs" {
  paths = [
    "<mount path on host to share>",
  ]
  comment = "<optional comment for this share>"
  hosts = [
    "<optional allowed host (hostname or IP address)>",
  ]
  networks = [
    "<optional allowed network in cidr notation>",
  ]
  alldirs = false
  enabled = true
  maproot_user = null
  maproot_group = null
  mapall_user = null
  mapall_group = null
  quiet = false
  ro = false
  security = [
    "<optional security mechanism (possible: krb5[i/p], sys) (needs NFSv4)>",
    "<optional security mechanism with lower priority>",
  ]
}
```
